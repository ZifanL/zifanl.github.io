    Hi, I’m Zifan (子凡), currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Adobe. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where my thesis focused on <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/4755dcb4b450d871d798dbdcf26fc258/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y" target="_blank">Data Validation and Selection for Modern Machine Learning</a>. Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work lies at the intersection of data management and machine learning, where I explore ways to make data-centric processes more efficient and accurate. Currently, I’m working on exciting projects in entity linking and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems, aiming to improve machine comprehension and interaction with structured data. Through my research and industry experience, I’m dedicated to advancing how we manage and utilize data to drive smarter, more robust ML models.
