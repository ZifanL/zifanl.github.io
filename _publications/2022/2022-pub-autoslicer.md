  Automated slicing aims to identify subsets of evaluation data where a trained model performs anomalously. This is an important problem for machine learning pipelines in production since it plays a key role in model debugging and comparison, as well as the diagnosis of fairness issues. We present Autoslicer, a scalable system that searches for problematic slices through distributed metric computation and hypothesis testing.
