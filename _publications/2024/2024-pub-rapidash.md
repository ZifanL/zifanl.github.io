abstract: >-
  Denial Constraint (DC) is a well-established formalism that captures a wide range of integrity constraints commonly encountered, including candidate keys, functional dependencies, and ordering constraints, among others. We establish a connection between orthogonal range search and DC violation detection. We then introduce Rapidash, a novel algorithm that demonstrates near-linear time and space complexity, representing a theoretical improvement over prior work.
